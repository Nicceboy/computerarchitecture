# Build information
This folder contains executable/library files for running the program.

To start server in it's folder:
```shell
java -jar KeywordServer.jar
```
Plugins from the 'plugins' folder will be downloaded automatically if there is any, and enabled then.


To start client in it's folder:
```shell
java -jar KeywordClient.jar
```

KeywordPlugin-api is just needed for developing the plugins and building them.

SampleAPI can be used for developing Java-based client to communicate with server.
